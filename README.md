<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The Fitness Exercise App is a mobile application designed for individuals who want to stay active and fit through structured exercise routines. It provides a guided workout experience with visual demonstrations, audio instructions and countdown timers to keep users engaged and motivated.

The app is built using MIT App Inventor, incorporating Text-to-Speech (TTS) for verbal workout instructions, visual exercise demonstrations, and a 30-second countdown timer to help users stay on track. Users can choose from three exercise categories, allowing them to customize their fitness routine based on their personal goals.

This project was developed with the goal of creating a simple yet effective fitness assistant, removing the need for printed workout guides or external trainers. By integrating audio, images and timers, this app ensures that users get a seamless exercise experience.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## **Development Process**
### **Challenges & Solutions**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring UI Simplicity & Readability**
Initially, the UI lacked proper structure, making navigation confusing.  
**Solution:**  
- Used Vertical Arrangements to group related components, ensuring a clean layout.  
- Ensured buttons were large, visible, and color-coded for quick identification.  
- Used consistent font sizes to maintain readability across different screen sizes.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Synchronizing Timer & Text-To-Speech**
Initially, the Text-To-Speech component finished speaking before the countdown timer reached zero.  
**Solution:**  
- Adjusted timing logic so that the speech aligned with exercise durations.  
- Implemented a 3-second countdown warning before transitioning to the next exercise.  
- Used Text-To-Speech prompts at key moments (start, mid, and end of an exercise) for better guidance.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging Issues with Clock Component**
Encountered issues where timers overlapped, causing countdown inconsistencies.  
**Solution:**  
- Ensured only one clock timer runs at a time by disabling all others before starting a new exercise.  
- Used conditional checks to prevent negative countdown values.  
- Implemented reset logic so each timer restarts correctly at the beginning of a new workout.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Fixing iOS Compatibility Issues (GIF Images)**
Initially, the app used GIF images for workout demonstrations, but iOS does not support GIF playback in MIT App Inventor.  
**Solution:**  
- Replaced GIFs with static images, ensuring compatibility across both Android and iOS.  
- Improved performance by reducing image file sizes, leading to a smoother user experience.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Improving Code Efficiency (Reducing Repetitive Blocks)**
The first version of the app contained repetitive block structures for each workout timer.  
**Solution:**  
- Used procedures (custom functions) to eliminate duplicate code.  
- Implemented a universal timer function that handles any exercise category dynamically.  
- This change reduced block clutter and made debugging much easier.  

<!-- FINAL OUTCOME -->

## **Final Outcome**
- UI is simple, clear, and structured.  
- Timers and Text-To-Speech are synchronized for a seamless workout experience.  
- No more overlapping timers or negative countdown issues.  
- The app is fully compatible with both Android and iOS.  

<!-- FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS -->

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add a progress tracking feature to log completed workouts.  
- Allow users to set custom workout durations based on personal - preferences.  
- Introduce a Dark Mode UI for better accessibility.

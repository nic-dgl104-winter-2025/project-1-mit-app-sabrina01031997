<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The Fitness Exercise App is a mobile application designed for individuals who want to stay active and fit through structured exercise routines. It provides a guided workout experience with visual demonstrations, audio instructions and countdown timers to keep users engaged and motivated.

The app is built using MIT App Inventor, incorporating Text-to-Speech (TTS) for verbal workout instructions, visual exercise demonstrations, and a 30-second countdown timer to help users stay on track. Users can choose from three exercise categories, allowing them to customize their fitness routine based on their personal goals.

This project was developed with the goal of creating a simple yet effective fitness assistant, removing the need for printed workout guides or external trainers. By integrating audio, images and timers, this app ensures that users get a seamless exercise experience.

<!-- KEY FEATURES -->

## Key Features
### Voice-Guided Workouts
- The app integrates Text-To-Speech (TTS) to provide verbal exercise instructions.
- Users can listen to instructions while focusing on the workout.

### Step-by-Step Exercise Demonstrations
- Each workout category includes high-quality images to guide users.
- Helps in understanding exercise form and technique.

### 30-Second Countdown Timer
- A built-in timer runs 30 seconds per exercise.
- Notifies the user when the time is up.

### User-Friendly Interface
- Simple layout designed for ease of use.
- Large buttons & clear navigation make the app accessible for all users.

### Workout Categories
Users can choose from three different fitness categories:
1. **Core Burner** ‚Äì Focused on core and abdominal exercises.
2. **Weight Loss** ‚Äì Includes cardio-based fat-burning exercises.
3. **Weight Gain** ‚Äì Designed for muscle-building and strength training.

Each category has a dedicated screen where users can view the exercise details and start their workout.

|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| **Screen**               | `Screen1`                               | The **main app screen** where all interactions occur. |
| **Labels**               | `Label1 - Label13`                      | Display **exercise instructions, countdown timers, and status messages**. |
| **Buttons**              | `Button1 - Button4`                     | Allow users to **navigate between screens** and **select exercises**. |
| **Images**               | `Image1 - Image9`                       | Provide **visual demonstrations** of exercises. |
| **TextBoxes**            | `TextBox2 - TextBox11`                  | Allow **users to input information** under images. |
| **Vertical Arrangements** | `VerticalArrangement1 - VerticalArrangement11` | **Organize UI elements** into structured sections. |

---

### **üîß Non-Visible Components (Blocks)**  
These components are **not directly visible** but handle the app's logic and **functionalities**.

| **Component**               | **Name(s)**                           | **Purpose** |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| **Clock (9 Instances)**      | `Clock1 - Clock9`                    | **Handles countdown timers** for exercises. |
| **Text-To-Speech (3 Instances)** | `TextToSpeech1 - TextToSpeech3` | **Guides users through workouts** using voice instructions. |

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## **Development Process**
### **Challenges & Solutions**
1. **Ensuring UI Simplicity & Readability**  
   - Used Vertical Arrangements for a structured layout.
   - Ensured buttons and text were large and readable.

2. **Synchronizing Timer & Text-To-Speech**  
   - Initially, Text-To-Speech finished before the timer.
   - Solution: Adjusted timing logic to ensure proper synchronization.

3. **Debugging Issues with Clock Component**  
   - Faced bugs where timers overlapped.
   - Fixed by handling each timer separately.

<!-- PLANNED FUTURE ENHANCEMENT -->

### **Planned Future Enhancements**
- **Workout Progress Tracking** ‚Äì Store exercise completion counts in **TinyDB**.
- **Custom Workout Durations** ‚Äì Allow users to **set their own workout durations**.
- **More Exercise Categories** ‚Äì Expand beyond the **three main categories**.

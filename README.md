<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The Fitness Exercise App is a mobile application designed for individuals who want to stay active and fit through structured exercise routines. It provides a guided workout experience with visual demonstrations, audio instructions and countdown timers to keep users engaged and motivated.

The app is built using MIT App Inventor, incorporating Text-to-Speech (TTS) for verbal workout instructions, visual exercise demonstrations, and a 30-second countdown timer to help users stay on track. Users can choose from three exercise categories, allowing them to customize their fitness routine based on their personal goals.

This project was developed with the goal of creating a simple yet effective fitness assistant, removing the need for printed workout guides or external trainers. By integrating audio, images and timers, this app ensures that users get a seamless exercise experience.
